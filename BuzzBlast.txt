Background Context:

Setting: Knox Country, Kentucky

Knox Country is a fictional region in Project Zomboid, heavily based on the Louisville metropolitan area, including towns like Muldraugh, West Point, Riverside, Rosewood, and Louisville. The area is known for its dense forests, suburban neighborhoods, and a variety of businesses ranging from diners to movie theaters.

Prelude to the Outbreak

In early 1993, Knox Country was a typical small American region. Early reports of unusual sickness and aggression began to surface in local news and rumors, but were largely ignored by the general populace. By Independence Day, July 4, 1993, these reports had escalated to violent attacks and biting incidents, overwhelming local hospitals in towns like Muldraugh and West Point.

The Knox Event

The U.S. military intervened by setting up an exclusion zone around Knox Country, attempting to contain what would become known as the Knox Event. The situation rapidly deteriorated as the military enforced strict quarantine measures. Skirmishes broke out between soldiers and infected individuals at the perimeter, leading to chaos and attracting more zombies to the area.

A photograph leaked from West Point showing a man with his arm ripped off wandering dazedly circulated, causing public panic. Continuous battles near the Knox Boundary camp failed to stop the influx of zombies. The military started pulling back north, and breaches in the containment fence worsened. By July 10, the first cases of the 'Knox Virus' appeared among people who had not been bitten, suggesting airborne transmission. Hospitals were overwhelmed as the infection spread rapidly.

Collapse of Order

By July 12, the majority of Louisville's population fell ill. The military demolished bridges over the Ohio River in a desperate attempt to contain the infection, killing hundreds of civilians. The White House issued conflicting messages, causing confusion, and the President's location became unknown, fueling speculation and fear. Reports confirmed the spread of the Knox illness to major cities worldwide, including Cincinnati, Columbus, Norfolk, Newcastle, London, Mogadishu, Seoul, and Okinawa.

Global Spread and Aftermath

Major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Tokyo reported widespread infections by July 18. Efforts to control the outbreak failed, and society began to collapse. General McGrew broadcasted a national message urging calm, which repeated over the next few days, but by then, most of the population was either dead or turned.

Survival in Knox Country

The remaining survivors in Knox Country were left to fend for themselves in a rapidly decaying world. Infrastructure collapsed, and resources became scarce. Survivors had to scavenge, build, and defend against the ever-present threat of zombies. As time progressed, the world became more desolate. Power and water shut off within a month, and nature began to reclaim urban areas. The gameâ€™s climate system reflects the humid subtropical weather patterns, adding another layer of survival challenge.

Cultural and Media References

The game world includes references to various media, from annotated maps to VHS tapes and TV broadcasts, providing background lore and context. These media pieces often contain hints, survivor stories, and fragmented information about the outbreak, helping players piece together the chaotic timeline of the Knox Event.
